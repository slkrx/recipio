With a thin crust, a very sweet sauce, no toppings but a scant sprinkle of mozzarella and full slices of provolone—well, it does deserve a certain reputation. I admit that it is good in a guilty-pleasure sort of way, and a really fun experiment. 2 tablespoons olive oil 3 cloves garlic , crushed 1/4 cup tomato paste 2 cups marinara sauce 1/4 cup water 1/4 cup white sugar , or to taste 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 1/4 teaspoon chili flakes (optional) 2 tablespoons olive oil 24 ounces pizza dough 3 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese 12 slices provolone cheese Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).

Add marinara, water, sugar, oregano, and chili flakes. Bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning and adjust if need be. Turn off heat and reserve. Roll and stretch dough into a rectangle about 15x10 inches. Rub a 13x18-inch half sheet pan with olive oil and transfer dough on. Push, pull, and stretch dough to cover pan. If dough pulls back from the edge, let it rest for a few minutes, and then continue shaping. Top dough with a light layer of sauce (the recipe will make extra sauce). Top with mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is cooked through, and the bottom is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. As soon as pizza comes out of the oven, top with slices of provolone. Pizza can be served immediately, or placed back in the oven for a few minutes to melt provolone even more.

29,"Orange Marmalade Side Dish Sauces and Condiments Canning and Preserving Jams and Jellies Recipes This orange marmalade recipe makes a sweet and citrusy preserve with just the slightest detectable bitterness that balances out the sweetness and tang perfectly. Orange and lemon rinds are suspended throughout the thickened marmalade and it has a lovely orange color as well. 5 small navel oranges (about 2¼ pounds), washed and scrubbed 1 medium lemon, washed and scrubbed 6 cups water 3 ½ cups granulated sugar Slice off and discard tops and bottoms from oranges and lemon. Peel off and discard skin and pith of 3 of the oranges. Quarter all oranges and lemon lengthwise, then thinly slice into 1/8-inch slices, discarding seeds while slicing. Place all citrus slices in a large bowl and cover with water. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios Pour orange and lemon slices along with water into a large stainless steel saucepan or Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until orange rinds have softened and can be cut with a spoon with slight resistance, about 45 minutes, skimming any foam that rises to top during process. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios Inspect four (½-pint) canning jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until orange marmalade is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. Place a small plate in the freezer. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios Add sugar to orange mixture and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has slightly reduced, bubbles are slightly larger in center, and a thermometer reads 220 degrees F (104 degrees C) about 40 to 45 minutes. Mixture will stay between 212 degrees F (100 degrees C) and 216 degrees F (102 degrees C) for the majority of this time and will rise to 220 degrees F (104 degrees C) when enough liquid has evaporated. To test if marmalade consistency is correct, remove plate from freezer and spoon a small amount of marmalade onto plate. Return plate to freezer for 1 minute. Remove plate from freezer; pull a finger through marmalade and across plate. It should leave a clean trail. If marmalade is runny and does not leave a clean trail, return mixture in pot to a boil over medium-high, and return plate to freezer. Boil marmalade, stirring often, for 3 minutes. Remove from heat, and retest thickness using plate again; repeat if necessary until it reaches desired thickness. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios Carefully pour marmalade evenly into the prepared canning jars. Let cool to room temperature, uncovered, about 3 hours. Seal jars. Chill until marmalade sets, at least 2 hours. Store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Dotdash Meredith Food Studios Cook’s Note If you are planning on storing the marmalade for a long time, you need to properly can it. Using tongs, lower empty jars (without lids and bands) into simmering water. Lay jars on their sides in pot so that they fill with water. Using jar lifter, turn jars right side up. Return to a gentle boil over high, reducing heat if needed to maintain a gentle boil, and boil for 10 minutes. Using a jar lifter, remove jars from pot, letting water drain back into pot. Place jars on a clean kitchen towel. Remove pot from heat; cover to keep water hot for final step of canning. Arrange jar bands and lids in a large, deep skillet. Add enough water to cover by 1/2 inch. Bring water to a simmer over medium-high. Remove from heat. (Overheating will weaken rubber and the lids' ability to seal properly.) Spoon hot marmalade into hot, sterilized jars, using a canning funnel to keep jar rims clean and leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wearing gloves, wipe jar rims with a damp paper towel. Using a magnetic lid lifter, lift lids out of hot water, and place on jars. Screw on jar bands until finger-tight. (Do not overtighten as the air in the jars needs to escape. If jar bands are too tight, the seal will fail or jars will crack.) Using jar lifter, lower jars into hot water in pot, making sure they're standing upright on canning rack and not touching one another or sides of the pot. Make sure jars are covered by 1 to 2 inches of water (add hot water if needed). Bring to a vigorous boil over high. Cover and boil 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and let stand 10 minutes. Using a jar lifter, remove jars from pot, and place on a clean kitchen towel 1 inch apart. Let cool to room temperature, about 3 hours. As jars come to room temperature, lids should curve inward as a sign of a safely preserved jar. Wipe jars clean, and label with name and date. If any jars fail to seal properly, store in refrigerator up to 2 weeks. Sealed jars may be stored in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year."

33,"Dry Red Beans in the Instant Pot Side Dish I don't buy canned red beans anymore; I use my Instant Pot to cook them from dry every time. I don't even have to think about soaking them ahead of time, since that's not needed. If you do decide to soak the beans, check your appliance manual because cooking time will be shorter. 2 ¼ cups dry kidney beans Pour beans into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Cover with a few inches of cool water. Close and lock the lid. Select Manual; set timer for 28 minutes on high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain beans and let cool. Cook’s Note Cook beans for 25 minutes if they're going into a soup, because they will continue cooking. Cook for 30 minutes if you're going to use the beans in salads or other finished dishes. Cooked beans freeze well! Pour cooled beans into an airtight container with some of the cooking liquid. Leave room at the top for expansion; cover with the lid and freeze. Or pour into a heavy-duty zip-top bag with some of the cooking liquid. Seal and place on a plate to freeze flat. Once frozen, the flat bags are easier to store."
34,"Beer-Boiled Shrimp with Old Bay Appetizers and Snacks Seafood Shrimp Easy, foolproof cooking technique. The Old Bay seasoning accentuates the shrimp rather than overpowers. A versatile dish that can fill many roles! Serve with cocktail sauce and/or melted butter. 4 (12 ounce) bottles beer 1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay) 1 teaspoon salt 1 lemon, halved crosswise 1 ½ pounds fresh shrimp, with shells and tails on Combine beer, seafood seasoning, and salt in a large saucepan or stockpot over medium-high heat. Squeeze juice from both lemon halves into the beer mixture and add both rinds to the beer. Stir and bring to a boil. Cover the pot and boil for 10 minutes. Add shrimp to boiling liquid, cover again with the lid, and turn off the heat. Transfer shrimp to serving bowls when they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes. Cook’s Note You can use your favorite shellfish boil seasoning instead of Old Bay, if desired. Get head-on shrimp if you can. And if you use frozen, make sure they are completely thawed before cooking."

36,"Chicken Rice-A-Roni Main Dishes Rice Made with shredded chicken, tender basmati rice, and smoky-sweet caramelized onions and peppers, this chicken Rice-A-Roni was inspired by a Lebanese rice and vermicelli pilaf. Garnish with fresh herbs, lemon juice, chili flakes, hot sauce, or even garlic-infused yogurt! Jump to recipe I didn't think about becoming a professional chef until High School, but my interest in all things food started way before then. Most of my earliest, most vivid childhood memories revolve around new foods, like my first visit to a Chinese restaurant, traveling to New York City to visit my Polish grandmother and her pierogi, my uncle Billy's homemade sausage, and something I pronounced shy-dia. Eating chicken and rice wasn't that unusual, but this was a whole new experience, since it was studded with chickpeas, and browned strands of pasta, not to mention it was sort of yellow. At that age I assumed it was some kind of Italian recipe, but as I got older I learned it was actually based on a Lebanese dish called Riz Bi Sha'rieh. From that time on, whenever I'd see an ad for Rice-a-Roni on TV, especially after I moved to San Francisco, I would smile knowingly. The San Francisco treat? I think not . Anyway, this is my version of that childhood favorite, and it remains one of my favorite comfort foods of all time, which is why I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy! 1 (3 ½) pound whole chicken 1 stalk celery, roughly chopped 1 medium carrot, roughly chopped ½ medium yellow onion, roughly chopped 1 large bay leaf 1 tablespoon kosher salt 3 quarts water 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 tablespoons butter ½ medium yellow onion, diced ⅓ cup diced red bell pepper 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 cup broken uncooked spaghetti (2-inch pieces) 1 ½ cups basmati rice ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper ¼ teaspoon dried oregano ½ teaspoon ground cumin ½ teaspoon saffron threads, crushed (Optional) 1 pinch cayenne pepper ½ cup garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed ⅓ cup frozen green peas, thawed and drained 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste Place chicken, celery, carrot, onion, and bay leaf in a stockpot and cover with water. Set over high heat, add salt, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the thighs and legs can be pulled easily from the carcass, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove chicken to a bowl, carefully tipping the carcass to drain any broth from the cavity back into the stockpot. Let meat sit until it's cool enough to handle, 15 to 20 minutes. Separate skin, bones, and meat. Set aside 2 cups shredded meat (white, dark, or a combination of the two) for rice-a-roni and reserve the rest for another use. Transfer skin and bones back to the stockpot with the broth and simmer for 1 to 2 hours or until you need it. Strain. Combine oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. When hot and melted, add onion, bell pepper, and salt. Cook and stir until onion just starts to turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add broken spaghetti and cook until toasted and light golden brown to dark brown in color, about 3 minutes; it's okay if the onions and peppers start to caramelize. Add rice and stir until completely coated. Add pepper, oregano, cumin, and saffron. Stir in 3 ½ cups chicken broth. Add cayenne, garbanzo beans, peas, and shredded chicken and return to a simmer. Cover tightly with a lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 15 minutes; do not lift the lid or stir during this time. Remove the lid and check the rice in a couple spots. It should be just barely tender. (If it seems undercooked, you can cover and cook for a few more minutes.) Replace the lid, turn off the heat, and let rice sit for 10 minutes. Sprinkle parsley and cilantro over top and stir to combine. Check for seasoning and serve immediately. Chicken Rice-a-Roni. Chef John Chef's Notes You can use leftover chicken and store-bought broth if you'd like, instead of making your own. Any long-grain white rice can be used instead of basmati if preferred. Editor's Note: Nutrition data for this recipe includes the full amount of chicken and broth. The actual amount of chicken and broth consumed will vary."

38,"Chef John's Copycat McRib Sandwich Meat and Poultry Pork Pork Rib Baby Back Ribs I tip my cap to a certain fast food franchise for coming up with the idea for a boneless baby back rib sandwich, the only downside being that they use about 60 mystery ingredients — ribs not necessarily being one of them. That's why you should try this easy homemade version with real ribs; simply bake, chill, cut, sauce, finish on the grill, and voilà! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. ⅓ cup kosher salt ¼ cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons chili powder 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 racks baby back pork ribs 1 cup barbecue sauce, divided 4 sesame hamburger rolls, split and toasted 1 cup coleslaw Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix salt, brown sugar, chili powder, pepper, cumin, and cayenne together for the rub. Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet. Season both sides generously with some of the rub. Reserve remaining rub for another use. Cover top with parchment paper and wrap foil over the edges. Cover the whole baking sheet with another large sheet of foil, sealing in the sides. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 2 hours and 45 minutes. Unwrap ribs and let cool briefly until safe to handle. Pull out the bones, stuffing any loose pieces of meat back into the holes and checking carefully for bone fragments. Wrap ribs back up and refrigerate until cold, 8 hours to overnight. Cut each rack in half. Brush both sides generously with barbecue sauce. Preheat a charcoal grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill ribs until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from grill and brush with more barbecue sauce. Drizzle more barbecue sauce onto each roll. Sandwich each rib section between a roll and top with coleslaw. Chef John Chef's Notes Make sure you don't get the larger St. Louis-style ribs. Feel free to season them with any dry rub of your choice. For the slaw, I used my sweet-hot mustard slaw . For the rolls, I used my sesame seed hamburger bun recipe, making 6 rectangles instead of 8 round buns. Editor's Note: Nutrition data for this recipe includes the full amount of dry rub. The actual amount consumed will vary."

52,"Scallop Gratin Seafood Shellfish Scallops As far as I'm concerned, a simple gratin is the most delicious way to cook fresh scallops. The only real way to screw this recipe up would be to use the wrong scallops. And by wrong, I mean any scallops that have been soaked in a preservative brine. These are easy to identify, as they're usually sitting in a pool of milky liquid. What you want are usually sold as wild 'day-boat,' 'diver,' or 'dry-pack' scallops. They are really expensive, and worth every penny.
