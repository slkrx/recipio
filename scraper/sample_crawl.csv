Using tongs, lower empty jars (without lids and bands) into simmering water. Lay jars on their sides in pot so that they fill with water. Using jar lifter, turn jars right side up. Return to a gentle boil over high, reducing heat if needed to maintain a gentle boil, and boil for 10 minutes. Using a jar lifter, remove jars from pot, letting water drain back into pot. Place jars on a clean kitchen towel. Remove pot from heat; cover to keep water hot for final step of canning.|Arrange jar bands and lids in a large, deep skillet. Add enough water to cover by 1/2 inch. Bring water to a simmer over medium-high. Remove from heat. (Overheating will weaken rubber and the lids' ability to seal properly.)|Spoon hot marmalade into hot, sterilized jars, using a canning funnel to keep jar rims clean and leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wearing gloves, wipe jar rims with a damp paper towel. Using a magnetic lid lifter, lift lids out of hot water, and place on jars. Screw on jar bands until finger-tight. (Do not overtighten as the air in the jars needs to escape. If jar bands are too tight, the seal will fail or jars will crack.)|Using jar lifter, lower jars into hot water in pot, making sure they're standing upright on canning rack and not touching one another or sides of the pot. Make sure jars are covered by 1 to 2 inches of water (add hot water if needed).|Bring to a vigorous boil over high. Cover and boil 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and let stand 10 minutes. Using a jar lifter, remove jars from pot, and place on a clean kitchen towel 1 inch apart. Let cool to room temperature, about 3 hours.|As jars come to room temperature, lids should curve inward as a sign of a safely preserved jar. Wipe jars clean, and label with name and date. If any jars fail to seal properly, store in refrigerator up to 2 weeks. Sealed jars may be stored in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year.","https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8530802/orange-marmalade/"

Garnish with fresh herbs, lemon juice, chili flakes, hot sauce, or even garlic-infused yogurt! Jump to recipe I didn't think about becoming a professional chef until High School, but my interest in all things food started way before then. Most of my earliest, most vivid childhood memories revolve around new foods, like my first visit to a Chinese restaurant, traveling to New York City to visit my Polish grandmother and her pierogi, my uncle Billy's homemade sausage, and something I pronounced shy-dia. Eating chicken and rice wasn't that unusual, but this was a whole new experience, since it was studded with chickpeas, and browned strands of pasta, not to mention it was sort of yellow. At that age I assumed it was some kind of Italian recipe, but as I got older I learned it was actually based on a Lebanese dish called Riz Bi Sha'rieh. From that time on, whenever I'd see an ad for Rice-a-Roni on TV, especially after I moved to San Francisco, I would smile knowingly. The San Francisco treat? I think not . Anyway, this is my version of that childhood favorite, and it remains one of my favorite comfort foods of all time, which is why I really do hope you give this a try soon.
